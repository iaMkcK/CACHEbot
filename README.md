Gambling Addiction Yacht Cache Bot Code

Hello and thanks for checking out my Code. As stated in the first code file, there are a few things needed if you wish to use this in your own Gang's Discord server.
First you must set up YAGPDB to aim at your server and do the normal setup procedures. Once you have that configured properly, you must change 3 things throughout the
entirety of my code for this bot. Those three things are as follows:

            #1 - Change ChannelID '1082576076758335498' to your own Betting-&-Winning-Announcement Channel #
            #2 - Change ChannelID '1081948603922259998' to your own Lounge Room Channel #
            #3 - Change RoleID '1084094169498271844' to your own # [Bot Wranglers/Admins]
        
I've tried hard to ensure that even on a fresh install, this should set every database entry you could need, but I could have missed some things. If you aren't sure
about something, please reach out to me on Discord or in CCO, in CCO I'm @SlightyPickledTree and on Discord iaMkcK#7193.

Once again, thank you for spending time in checking out my project, and also reading this README. It is appreciated beyond belief <3
